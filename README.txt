Should I choose DEVELOPER edition or DEFAULT version?

It depends for what reason you are gonna use it.
If you are just going to use it for fun or home, use the DEFAULT version.
If you are a developer or want to keep your files secure, get the developer version.

Currently I suggest using the 1.0.3 developer version, it's the newest one and has the most features.
Use 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 DEFAULT if you do not need these FANCY FEATURES LOL.

Anyways, thank you for using my software.

(This literal garbage took me idk, a month or two?)
