How do I use CmdFileManager?

Once you downloaded CmdFileManager, either add it's folder to PATH or put the CmdFileManager.exe into System32.
For those who do not know, System32 is located in C:\Windows\System32.

After you added CmdFileManager to path or put it in System32, open Command prompt and type:
CmdFileManager
You can also write it without capital letters or in all capital letters.
CMDFILEMANAGER
cmdfilemanager

or
cmDfilemanager (anything saying cmdfilemanager works.)

And there you have it. Enjoy using it.
